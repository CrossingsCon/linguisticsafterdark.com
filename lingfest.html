<p>Modern usage got you tense? Can’t start up your conjugator? Or maybe you’d just like to make like a schwa and destress. Call into our live show with your burning language questions and our two linguist hosts will answer them for you. Just one catch: we can’t do any research before answering. So if your language is making a funny noise, we’ll get to the bottom of it, with some rowdy discussion, bad nerdy jokes, and a lot of linguistics along the way.</p>
<p>Join us on YouTube (link coming soon) at 3pm EDT/12pm PDT on April 24 for a couple hours of chaotic language fun, and this time we'll be taking your questions LIVE!</p>
<p>The event will be autocaptioned live, and then we will edit the captions for the permanent post, and add a transcript.</p>
<p>Admission is free with no need to register, but <a href="https://ko-fi.com/emfozzing">Ko-fi tips</a> are much appreciated!</p>
