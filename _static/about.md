Emfozzing Enterprises, Inc. is dedicated to creating spaces online and offline where people can bring the things they love, share them with others, and find paths to new areas of interest. We started as a group of fans for Diane Duane's _Young Wizards_ series, but what we discovered is that everyone we met had something cool they cared about to share, and that fiction tied it all together. Our spaces are dedicated to being accessible, welcoming, imaginative, and exploratory; come join us and discover what thing you didn't know you were going to learn about today!

Emfozzing Enterprises sponsors two main things:

- [CrossingsCon](https://www.crossingscon.org), a convention about the _Young Wizards_ series and all the other universes out there that we visit when we read
- [The Young Wizards Slack](http://www.crossingscon.org/community/slack/), the offline reflection of that convention that doesn't have to end after three days
