0:00:07.300,0:00:11.160
JENNY: Hi! and welcome to Linguistics After Dark. I'm Jenny,

0:00:11.160,0:00:13.240
SARAH: I'm Sarah,
ELI: and I'm Eli.

0:00:13.240,0:00:19.240
ELI: If you've got a question about language, and you want experts to answer it without having done any research whatsoever,

0:00:19.240,0:00:20.840
ELI: we're your podcast.

0:00:20.840,0:00:24.080
JENNY: Settle in, grab a snack or a drink, and enjoy!

0:00:24.080,0:00:27.160
ELI: I like to think of us as Car Talk for linguistics,

0:00:27.380,0:00:30.860
ELI: like if your language is making a funny noise and you don't know what it is,

0:00:30.860,0:00:33.220
ELI: you can call us up and ask.
SARAH: [laughs]

0:00:33.220,0:00:38.680
SARAH: So, apparently, the first episode, my family listened to in the car

0:00:38.680,0:00:45.880
as they were driving to our family Christmas thing, and my dad, who raised me on Car Talk,

0:00:45.880,0:00:52.480
was just like "Oh, yes. This." And then we got to the puzzler segment, and they were like,

0:00:52.480,0:00:55.180
"You are straight-up ripping off Car Talk,"
JENNY: [laughs]

0:00:55.180,0:00:57.860
and he told me that when we got together, and I was like, "Yes!"

0:00:57.860,0:00:59.420
ELI: Yes.
SARAH: "Yes, we straight-up are."

0:00:59.420,0:01:02.840
ELI: We 100% are ripping off Car Talk, and it's great!

0:01:02.840,0:01:07.840
SARAH: Also, fun fact, when I was in college and I was taking my intro linguistics class,

0:01:07.840,0:01:14.030
one of our extra credit homework assignments was to listen to Car Talk and analyze the—

0:01:14.030,0:01:16.280
analyze the Klick and Klack accents.

0:01:16.280,0:01:19.740
ELI: Oh my gosh.
SARAH: Um, and I was like, "Are you kidding,

0:01:19.740,0:01:23.640
you're gonna give me points in class for
doing something I do anyway?"

0:01:23.640,0:01:26.380
SARAH and JENNY: Amazing!
JENNY: [laughs]
SARAH: It was so good.

0:01:26.380,0:01:31.880
ELI: I mean, that's all of intro ling for people
who know that they're gonna be linguists
SARAH: That's true.

0:01:31.880,0:01:35.600
JENNY: [laughs]
ELI: Cool! Shall we all learn a
language thing?

0:01:35.610,0:01:37.040
JENNY: Let's! Yes!

0:01:37.040,0:01:41.620
SARAH: All right, I'm so excited about this language thing.
ELI: Yeahhhh!

0:01:41.620,0:01:43.280
SARAH: So, did you know

0:01:43.280,0:01:49.360
that there's a gummy candy that you can use to compare the sounds available in different languages,

0:01:49.360,0:01:54.523
and also study languages' potential historic connection to one another?

0:01:54.523,0:01:58.600
ELI: No? This feels—
SARAH: It's the Swadesh fish.

0:01:58.600,0:02:00.860
[ELI and JENNY laugh, confused]

0:02:00.860,0:02:02.680
[SARAH laughs]

0:02:02.680,0:02:07.280
ELI: I don't—I don't—I feel like I learned a
thing but it's not the thing you wanted me to learn.

0:02:07.280,0:02:09.640
[laughter]

0:02:09.640,0:02:13.960
SARAH: Okay, so, I've been sitting on
that pun for like a year,

0:02:13.960,0:02:22.180
SARAH: So, a Swadesh list, which is not the same thing as Swedish fish, is a list of words

0:02:22.180,0:02:26.570
SARAH: developed by… somebody whose last name was Swadesh, I forget his first name—

0:02:26.570,0:02:31.660
ELI: —and we don't do research.
SARAH: —and we don't do research—
ELI: Look—look to the show notes to find out.

0:02:31.660,0:02:32.460
SARAH: Yeah.

0:02:32.460,0:02:35.020
SARAH: Or just imagine that he never had a first name. Either way.

0:02:35.020,0:02:37.060
ELI: [laughs]
SARAH: So—[laughs]

0:02:37.060,0:02:42.360
SARAH: So, this guy, Swadesh, wrote a list of like 250-something words, that

0:02:42.360,0:02:46.220
has been revised a few times and replaced by other people's lists and whatever,

0:02:46.220,0:02:51.400
but it was like, "culturally stable," quote-unquote, words

0:02:51.400,0:02:55.540
that you could ask speakers of any language to produce,

0:02:55.540,0:03:01.940
and then you could write down what they say, and compare the words or the sounds

0:03:01.940,0:03:05.900
across several languages, to see if those languages are related.

0:03:05.900,0:03:09.700
ELI: So this is like kinship terms and that kind of thing,
SARAH: Yeah, like kinship—

0:03:09.709,0:03:12.260
ELI: Like, "what's your name for 'mom' and 'dad' and—" 
SARAH: Right.

0:03:12.260,0:03:15.720
SARAH: Basic pronouns, basic animals, basic body parts,

0:03:15.720,0:03:24.720
things like the sky, the ground, water… things that are not very much culturally dependent.

0:03:24.720,0:03:29.600
SARAH: So the list has been revised a few times, based on, like,

0:03:29.600,0:03:34.680
things that they discovered in the process of using it actually *are* kind of culturally dependent,

0:03:34.680,0:03:37.080
so they either replaced a word or knocked it off.

0:03:37.080,0:03:40.940
SARAH: And then, like, other people later on wrote better lists that people use now, but

0:03:40.940,0:03:47.100
this was the first one that was really
used to do this kind of cross-linguistic historical analysis?

0:03:47.100,0:03:54.280
SARAH: But I also used it for a project where I was pretending to do linguistic fieldwork,

0:03:54.280,0:04:00.680
because it was for class, and I was studying Romanian, which is a language we do know about,

0:04:00.680,0:04:06.900
it has been documented, but I was forbidden from—
ELI: I thought you were gonna say, "I was studying Romanian, which is a language."

0:04:06.900,0:04:09.020
[laughter]

0:04:09.020,0:04:12.430
SARAH: It is, that's true.

0:04:12.430,0:04:17.200
SARAH: No, I—so I got a friend of mine who speaks Romanian,

0:04:17.200,0:04:21.580
and I was not allowed to look up anything about Romanian,

0:04:21.580,0:04:25.600
I just had to ask her to produce these words,

0:04:25.600,0:04:27.260
SARAH: so I would be like "how do you say 'mom',"

0:04:27.260,0:04:32.220
and she would say whatever is the Romanian word for "mom," and I went through this list of like 200 words,

0:04:32.220,0:04:38.820
and as she said them, I wrote down the phonetic transcription of the word,

0:04:38.820,0:04:40.340
and sometimes asked her,

0:04:40.340,0:04:46.280
"oh, so," y'know, "'mom' is a word; is… 'pom' also a word?"

0:04:46.280,0:04:52.920
SARAH: and if she said "yes, that's a different word," or "no, that's not a word," or "oh, that's the same word,"

0:04:52.920,0:05:01.200
then based on her reaction to my question I could decide whether, like, [m] and [p] were both sounds that existed,

0:05:01.200,0:05:05.770
or sounds that didn't exist, or the same sound, to a Romanian speaker.

0:05:05.770,0:05:11.280
SARAH: And so I did this for a phonetics class, and I had to pretend to be like, a linguistic field worker

0:05:11.280,0:05:15.740
figuring out what the different sounds available in Romanian are.

0:05:15.740,0:05:20.730
Which was really fun! And I would love to do it again sometime.

0:05:20.730,0:05:28.440
ELI: Yeah, I agree, I found that—we did a field methods class when I was studying linguistics in college,

0:05:28.440,0:05:33.840
and that is one of my favorite things that I have done, when I was studying linguistics.

0:05:33.840,0:05:34.660
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:05:34.660,0:05:40.540
ELI: We specifically picked a language that nobody in the class knew and then we broke up, like,

0:05:40.548,0:05:44.440
different aspects of the grammar, or the morphology, or the phonology,

0:05:44.440,0:05:47.780
ELI: so—I mean, we had a whole semester, it wasn't intro,

0:05:47.780,0:05:53.320
and we, like—we constructed a grammar of siSwati.

0:05:53.320,0:05:55.080
SARAH (hushed): That's so cool.
ELI: Yeah.

0:05:55.080,0:06:00.750
ELI: So do you have an example of a word on a Swadesh list that

0:06:00.750,0:06:04.680
was found to be culturally dependent, and so was removed?

0:06:04.680,0:06:06.830
SARAH (slowly, thinking): Um… yes.

0:06:06.830,0:06:13.640
SARAH: Oh, so they originally had the word for "claw," like an animal claw,
ELI: Mm-hm.

0:06:13.640,0:06:16.260
SARAH: but it turns out there's several languages

0:06:16.260,0:06:21.060
where "claws" for animal and "fingernails" for humans are not distinguished?

0:06:21.060,0:06:22.840
ELI: Oh, interesting.
SARAH: And so…

0:06:22.840,0:06:26.080
SARAH: But like, the underlying concept was "fingernail,"

0:06:26.080,0:06:31.920
and then I guess "claw" is a more specific word in more languages than "fingernail,"

0:06:31.920,0:06:34.320
SARAH: so they replaced "claw" with "fingernail"
JENNY: Cool

0:06:34.320,0:06:37.540
SARAH: so that you'd be getting the more general word in each language

0:06:37.540,0:06:40.720
SARAH: so that it was easier to see the historical connections.

0:06:40.720,0:06:44.140
ELI: That's really cool! and it sounds like a useful thing to have,

0:06:44.140,0:06:51.280
and probably something that linguists are still hammering out how exactly we can best use them, and what words should be on them.

0:06:51.280,0:06:52.940
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:06:52.940,0:06:59.860
ELI: Okay, let's head to the main part of the show, with real language questions from real listeners.

0:06:59.860,0:07:04.690
ELI: As a reminder, if you want to send us a
question, you can email it in text to

0:07:04.690,0:07:07.600
questions@linguisticsafterdark.com

0:07:07.600,0:07:11.900
Or you can send us an audio recording of you speaking your question aloud.

0:07:11.900,0:07:15.260
ELI: Especially for those phonology and accent questions,

0:07:15.260,0:07:19.460
ELI: it's really good to hear the accent that you're trying to talk about,

0:07:19.460,0:07:24.080
or the words that you're trying to talk about, so definitely email that audio in.

0:07:24.080,0:07:25.520
JENNY: Okay!

0:07:25.520,0:07:33.460
JENNY: Bex asks via Slack, "What composes an accent? Popularly it's sound production and word order,

0:07:33.460,0:07:38.020
but if I recall correctly, word choice is also a factor, so what else?"

0:07:38.020,0:07:44.240
and galadryels asks via Slack, "Also, little-kid speak: is it its own dialect?"

0:07:44.240,0:07:51.100
ELI: So we put these two questions together because they are phonetics-y things,

0:07:51.100,0:07:54.100
ELI: which also means that I'm going to throw this question at Sarah.

0:07:54.100,0:08:00.420
SARAH: Yeah, so, the first thing I thought about from Bex's question was that, yeah, accent is basically sound production.

0:08:00.420,0:08:06.180
SARAH: I tend to think of word order and word choice as being dialect.

0:08:06.180,0:08:08.480
JENNY: Mm-hm.
ELI: Yeah, I would agree with that.

0:08:08.480,0:08:13.120
SARAH: So accent is typically, yeah, how you produce the sounds—

0:08:13.120,0:08:20.140
what vowels you use, what consonants you use, and in what contexts you use them.

0:08:20.140,0:08:23.500
SARAH: Because—I guess—one of my favorite examples,

0:08:23.500,0:08:29.000
which I feel like I might have talked about on a previous episode? but I also might not have, I don't know.

0:08:29.000,0:08:36.440
SARAH: I had two friends growing up that used the sound [eɪ] in words that I didn't,

0:08:36.440,0:08:39.180
but they used them in two different sets of words.

0:08:39.180,0:08:43.580
SARAH: So, one of them would eat  scrambled [eɪ]ggs for breakfast,

0:08:43.580,0:08:47.360
and he had l[eɪ]gs that he walked with,

0:08:47.360,0:08:51.900
and I was like, "What are you doing, the sound in those words is [ε]!"

0:08:51.900,0:08:53.740
SARAH: And he was like, "You're wrong."

0:08:53.740,0:08:58.720
SARAH: And then, I also had a friend who carried her books to school in a b[eɪ]g,

0:08:58.720,0:09:02.080
and dogs, like, w[eɪ]gged their tails,

0:09:02.080,0:09:04.880
and I was like, "What are you doing, that sound is [æ]!"

0:09:04.880,0:09:07.820
SARAH: And she was like, "No, you're wrong."
JENNY: [laughs]
SARAH: And so, it's like,

0:09:07.820,0:09:12.440
SARAH: what sounds you have, but also what contexts you put them in.

0:09:12.440,0:09:15.920
ELI: Yeah, I mean, I think that there's 
a point to be made here

0:09:15.920,0:09:19.660
for people who haven't gone through a phonology class,

0:09:19.660,0:09:24.200
that sounds are not just the sound itself,

0:09:24.200,0:09:26.880
like the vowel itself or the consonant itself.

0:09:26.880,0:09:33.520
ELI: Sounds are a production of the environment, meaning the sounds that are on either side of them,

0:09:33.520,0:09:38.840
and occasionally, sometimes, supposedly, some sounds that are, like, even a little bit further away.

0:09:38.840,0:09:43.320
ELI: Or like the—whether that part of the word is stressed or not,

0:09:43.320,0:09:47.810
that that can affect what sound actually comes out of your mouth,

0:09:47.810,0:09:52.200
as opposed to what sound is in
your brain that belongs to that word.

0:09:52.200,0:10:00.800
ELI: Which also sometimes is why you don't
hear if somebody else has an accent, if it's slightly different than yours,

0:10:00.800,0:10:05.720
or if it's close enough, right, if you're not consciously focusing on that.

0:10:05.720,0:10:08.340
ELI: Or if somebody tells you that *you* have an accent,

0:10:08.340,0:10:12.260
you're gonna say no, not just because it's the way that you've always spoken,

0:10:12.260,0:10:18.720
but also because you don't hear the word that comes out of your mouth and throat,

0:10:18.720,0:10:22.620
ELI: you hear the word as the set of sounds that exists in your head.

0:10:22.620,0:10:23.680
SARAH: Yeah.

0:10:23.680,0:10:28.300
ELI: And your accent is kind of like a filter that goes on top of what's in your head,

0:10:28.300,0:10:33.040
to in between your brain and your throat and mouth.

0:10:33.040,0:10:34.660
SARAH: Yes.

0:10:34.660,0:10:38.120
SARAH: One of my other favorite things having to do with that was—

0:10:38.120,0:10:42.180
SARAH: I think, in the same class where we had the Car Talk assignment?

0:10:42.180,0:10:45.360
SARAH: Shout-out Professor Barnes, great human being.

0:10:45.360,0:10:54.540
SARAH: Um, he played us a clip of someone saying the sound—or word, I guess—[blak],

0:10:54.540,0:10:56.940
and asked us what word it was.

0:10:56.940,0:11:00.400
SARAH: I'm gonna say it again, and then I want to hear what each of you thinks what word I'm saying.

0:11:00.400,0:11:02.520
SARAH: And listeners, play along!

0:11:02.520,0:11:04.020
SARAH: [blak]

0:11:04.020,0:11:05.980
SARAH: Jenny, what did you hear?

0:11:05.980,0:11:08.770
JENNY: I definitely heard ⟨black⟩ like the color.

0:11:08.770,0:11:10.700
SARAH: Okay. Eli, what did you hear?

0:11:10.700,0:11:13.630
ELI: I also heard ⟨black⟩ as in the color. 
SARAH: Okay.

0:11:13.630,0:11:19.080
SARAH: So then, he played us the longer clip with the speaker saying the whole sentence,

0:11:19.080,0:11:22.360
where the speaker said, "around the [blak]."

0:11:22.360,0:11:24.140
JENNY: Ah.
SARAH: What is it?

0:11:24.140,0:11:32.840
JENNY: So I heard around the ⟨block⟩ that time, with a like fairly strong accent… Wow, yeah, that's really cool.

0:11:32.840,0:11:34.420
SARAH: Eli, what do you think?

0:11:34.420,0:11:42.830
ELI: I mean obviously we were primed for it, but yeah, that word is definitely ⟨block⟩ as in a city block.
SARAH: Yes.

0:11:42.830,0:11:48.080
SARAH: And I'm particularly interested, Eli,
does that sound familiar to you, that like accent?

0:11:48.080,0:11:50.270
ELI: Yeah, I have no problem with that.

0:11:50.270,0:11:53.240
SARAH: It is the Chicago /ɑ/.
ELI: Yes.

0:11:53.240,0:11:56.620
SARAH: Which, obviously you live in Chicago, that should not be surprising.

0:11:56.620,0:12:02.300
ELI: No, and I don't quite have that. I have final devoicing, but I don't quite have that.

0:12:02.300,0:12:07.320
SARAH: Um, but it's really interesting, because when you hear the word in isolation,

0:12:07.320,0:12:12.760
you hear it as, like, whatever it is to you?

0:12:12.760,0:12:16.080
but as soon as you get it into a context—

0:12:16.080,0:12:21.300
SARAH: and he probably did a better job giving us an entire sentence, where you also heard more of the speaker's voice,

0:12:21.300,0:12:27.220
but I don't remember the sentence and I'm not good enough at imitating the accent to do it off the top of my head—

0:12:27.220,0:12:31.260
SARAH: but as soon as you realize that that's what's happening, like,

0:12:31.260,0:12:34.900
the entire vowel space in your head just adjusts itself,

0:12:34.900,0:12:41.080
and you stop noticing or caring that the other person is saying slightly different vowels from what you're saying,

0:12:41.080,0:12:45.920
because you're like, "Oh, well, they say [æ] for [ɑ] and they say [eə] for [æ],"

0:12:45.920,0:12:50.120
SARAH: and it just like cycles around, and your brain is totally cool with it.

0:12:50.120,0:12:54.780
ELI: This is the thing that happened to me when I was a kid and we went on a trip to London

0:12:54.780,0:12:56.200
SARAH: Mm-hm?

0:12:56.200,0:13:01.600
ELI: I had the hardest time understanding people, for about the first 12 hours.

0:13:01.600,0:13:06.720
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: —and then something happened, and I was totally fine.

0:13:06.720,0:13:13.540
ELI: and I remember realizing it about a day into the trip and just being like, "Oh, okay!"

0:13:13.540,0:13:19.120
ELI: I was having to ask people to repeat themselves a lot, and all of a sudden I didn't have to.

0:13:19.120,0:13:21.580
ELI: Which is really cool! Brains are cool!

0:13:21.580,0:13:24.420
JENNY: They really are.
SARAH: Brains are amazing.

0:13:24.420,0:13:28.120
ELI: But I think that this also—this plugs back into Bex's question,

0:13:28.120,0:13:32.140
ELI: about word choice
SARAH: Mm-hm
ELI: and word order?

0:13:32.140,0:13:36.640
ELI: Which—I'm interested to know what they're referring to, with "word order."

0:13:36.640,0:13:44.620
ELI: Word choice comes with dialect things, which often also comes with an accent, but they're two different things,

0:13:44.620,0:13:52.400
and that word choice is going to be part of the dialect, which you would use with whatever accent you're gonna use.

0:13:52.400,0:13:55.590
SARAH: Right.
JENNY: Mm-hm.
ELI: But sometimes this is where you get, like,

0:13:55.590,0:14:03.060
"Oh, the lilt" or "the brogue" or that kind
of thing, where people kind of just lump it all in together.

0:14:03.060,0:14:08.200
SARAH: Yeah, I think word order—again, I don't know exactly what Bex was intending by that,

0:14:08.200,0:14:14.560
SARAH: but I—the thing that comes to my mind for it is whether you say, like,

0:14:14.560,0:14:17.580
"plug in something" or "plug something in",

0:14:17.580,0:14:25.140
SARAH: or how flexible you can be with raising—Is it called "raising" with parts of the sentence?

0:14:25.140,0:14:28.100
ELI: Uh...
SARAH: Topicalization kind of stuff? 
ELI: Yeah.

0:14:28.100,0:14:33.580
SARAH: Yeah, so how flexible you can be with raising a later part of the sentence earlier

0:14:33.580,0:14:38.580
to emphasize things, or whether you can just raise it up and it's not emphatic necessarily.

0:14:38.580,0:14:43.760
SARAH: So, I can say, like, "The car, I bought."

0:14:43.760,0:14:49.960
SARAH: And if you just mean that to be "I bought the car," for most people that's weird.

0:14:49.960,0:14:54.500
SARAH: I can imagine there are some dialects where that's less weird. I don't know.

0:14:54.500,0:15:00.800
ELI: I mean there's a pretty solid—like if you grew up in a family where

0:15:00.800,0:15:06.980
your parents or grandparents were Yiddish or German, like, spoke Yiddish or German,

0:15:06.980,0:15:13.640
ELI: then you will really often get that kind of thing, and sometimes it's emphatic and sometimes it's not.

0:15:13.640,0:15:16.260
SARAH: Yeah, actually the example I had in mind

0:15:16.260,0:15:21.800
was an English teacher I had who did, she—her family spoke Yiddish,

0:15:21.800,0:15:26.760
and she apologized to us on, like, the first or second day of school and said, "Look,

0:15:26.760,0:15:31.020
I'm gonna say some weird things, like, 'throw me up the stairs the hat,'

0:15:31.020,0:15:34.480
instead of 'throw the hat up the stairs to me'.

0:15:34.480,0:15:42.380
Just like, that's just how my parents talk, so it's how I talk, and if I say something that you don't understand, just tell me to re-say it."

0:15:42.380,0:15:45.700
SARAH: And so I've had that sentence, like, in my brain as an example.

0:15:45.700,0:15:47.960
ELI: I like that.
JENNY: That's fun, yeah.

0:15:47.960,0:15:51.760
ELI: So let's move on to galadryels' part of 
this question,

0:15:51.760,0:15:57.560
which is about little-kid speak, and whether that's a dialect or an accent, or what is going on there.

0:15:57.560,0:15:58.800
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:15:58.800,0:16:04.500
SARAH: That's a really good question because it then gets to, like, "Well, what is a dialect?"

0:16:04.500,0:16:08.680
SARAH: And as we were talking about the whole accent thing and, like Eli was saying,

0:16:08.680,0:16:15.080
word choice moves into the concept of a
dialect that accent kind of overlays with,

0:16:15.080,0:16:20.060
there's also, like, that spectrum of
dialect to language.

0:16:20.060,0:16:25.440
SARAH: So there's that famous quip that's like, "A language is just a dialect with an army and a navy,"

0:16:25.440,0:16:29.020
which I think is cool and, like, definitely true,

0:16:29.020,0:16:33.880
because we associate languages with geopolitical entities, usually?

0:16:33.880,0:16:39.620
But like, if you go to Germany and if you go to the Netherlands,

0:16:39.620,0:16:41.820
you expect to hear German and Dutch,

0:16:41.820,0:16:49.660
but actually in the region on either side of the political border between Germany and the Netherlands,

0:16:49.660,0:16:58.600
those speakers of Dutch and those speakers of German—I think, if I recall correctly—are more mutually intelligible to each other,

0:16:58.600,0:17:06.800
or *are* mutually intelligible to each other, in a way that they are not with other speakers in their own country,

0:17:06.800,0:17:15.260
or the speakers farther away from each other in Germany and the Netherlands would be.

0:17:15.260,0:17:19.660
SARAH: And so, if you had just drawn those political borders slightly differently,

0:17:19.660,0:17:22.800
you could have three different "languages," quote-unquote.

0:17:22.800,0:17:29.620
SARAH: Or just one language! And you would just be like, "Oh, these are dialects of… Germanodutch.

0:17:29.620,0:17:33.480
SARAH: Or whatever. Deutschdutch.

0:17:33.480,0:17:35.160
ELI: Yeah, exactly.

0:17:35.160,0:17:41.260
ELI: You can see some similar stuff with like the northern Midwest and Canada,
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:17:41.260,0:17:46.480
ELI: Where you've got a lot of similar things
happening phonologically and, I think,

0:17:46.480,0:17:49.800
like, morphologically and syntactically,

0:17:49.800,0:17:54.860
ELI: where American English and Canadian English start to overlap,

0:17:54.860,0:17:59.600
ELI: but those are, like, two well-established dialects that we talk about.

0:17:59.600,0:18:01.032
SARAH and JENNY: Mm-hm.

0:18:01.032,0:18:05.280
JENNY: I was also thinking about—I don't remember which countries it is,

0:18:05.280,0:18:10.940
but you've got situations in Scandinavia, I think, where

0:18:10.940,0:18:17.400
you'll have, like, a mutual intelligibility thing, and if they weren't two different countries

0:18:17.400,0:18:25.240
then they would be considered different
dialects, because there's so much overlap, and so much, like,

0:18:25.240,0:18:31.280
so much of the language is mutually intelligible—er, the—of the languages are mutually intelligible.

0:18:31.280,0:18:38.160
JENNY: Versus, like, Italy, where you have all these different quote-unquote "dialects,"

0:18:38.160,0:18:46.840
that are so completely mutually unintelligible that if they weren't all in Italy,

0:18:46.840,0:18:52.200
they would be considered different languages, but they get talked about as being dialects of Italian.

0:18:52.200,0:18:55.740
SARAH: I was about to say the same thing about China.
JENNY: Ooohhh, uh-huh.

0:18:55.740,0:19:00.100
SARAH: 'Cause people always describe Mandarin and Cantonese as being dialects.

0:19:00.100,0:19:06.520
SARAH: And like, they share a writing system and they share some historical roots,

0:19:06.520,0:19:11.440
like there's a lot of phrases that you can see how they are similar to each other, like—

0:19:11.440,0:19:16.060
SARAH: I suck at Cantonese, but nǐ hǎo (你好) in Mandarin

0:19:16.060,0:19:21.460
and like nei hou (你好)—except with better
tones—in Cantonese are both "hello,"

0:19:21.460,0:19:25.560
but then a lot of other phrases aren't even that close to the same,

0:19:25.560,0:19:32.320
SARAH: let alone all of the other, uh... I'm gonna say *languages* that are spoken in China.

0:19:32.320,0:19:37.700
SARAH: But people just say, "oh, it's a dialect of Chinese," and I feel like we really should be calling them Chinese languages.

0:19:37.700,0:19:42.880
ELI: Yeah, Victor Mair from Language Log usually uses the word "topolects"—

0:19:42.880,0:19:45.580
SARAH: Oooh!
ELI: —to kind of sidestep the whole

0:19:45.580,0:19:50.500
ELI: language/dialect thing, I think especially because there's some political considerations there.
JENNY: Mm-hm.

0:19:50.500,0:19:52.480
Sarah: Yeah. That's a good word.

0:19:52.480,0:19:55.080
ELI: That makes it really clear that it's—

0:19:55.080,0:19:58.980
ELI: that those, like, those languages or those topolects, I guess,

0:19:58.980,0:20:03.760
are really specifically languages that belong to a specific place.

0:20:03.760,0:20:05.120
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:20:05.120,0:20:07.820
ELI: I think it also sidesteps the idea that

0:20:07.820,0:20:11.820
there are some languages that are within
the Chinese borders, that

0:20:11.820,0:20:17.620
are definitely not Sinitic languages, that kind of get lumped in with Chinese.

0:20:17.620,0:20:20.060
JENNY: Yeah, that's a good point.

0:20:20.300,0:20:26.360
ELI: Yeah, so topolect goes into this whole
thing where you have dialect,

0:20:26.360,0:20:30.700
there's topolect, there's famililect, which is, like, within your own family,

0:20:30.700,0:20:35.780
and there's idiolect, which is like, the dialect that is just you! 
SARAH: Yeah!

0:20:35.780,0:20:38.480
ELI: You're the only speaker of that dialect!

0:20:38.480,0:20:43.360
ELI: And then language just gets to be special because it has this

0:20:43.360,0:20:51.480
political affiliation, which is also why there's a lot of like separatist regions or claims for independence

0:20:51.480,0:20:56.210
that are based around, "Well, we have our own language." You know, you've got—

0:20:56.210,0:21:02.040
ELI: in Spain, you've got the Basque region and you've got Catalonia speaking Catalan, right?
JENNY: Mm-hmm.

0:21:02.040,0:21:08.920
ELI: Not that Linguistics After Dark takes any particular political stances on the geopolitical stage.
JENNY: Right.

0:21:08.920,0:21:11.560
ELI: So what do we think about this little-kid speak thing?

0:21:11.570,0:21:16.940
ELI: I mean, I think there's a question, is this the language of small children,

0:21:16.940,0:21:21.800
or is this the language that adults tend to speak to babies?

0:21:21.800,0:21:22.680
SARAH: True.

0:21:22.680,0:21:28.520
ELI: I think we should approach this from the idea of what adults say to little kids, because

0:21:28.520,0:21:31.160
little kids learning to talk is acquisition.

0:21:31.160,0:21:33.500
ELI: We've been talking about dialect and accent.

0:21:33.500,0:21:38.580
ELI: If y'all want to learn about acquisition, send us a question about acquisition and we'll talk about that.

0:21:38.580,0:21:41.380
ELI: But for this, what do we think about baby talk?

0:21:41.380,0:21:47.180
JENNY: I would have said that's less a
dialect and more a register.

0:21:47.180,0:21:49.380
ELI: Oh!
SARAH: Yeah!
ELI: I like that.

0:21:49.380,0:21:51.480
ELI: What's—can you explain what a register is?

0:21:51.480,0:21:57.980
JENNY: So a register is like the style or mode of speaking.

0:21:57.980,0:22:03.220
JENNY: Like, one person with one dialect can have multiple registers.

0:22:03.220,0:22:07.680
JENNY: So I have a register for academic English for when I'm writing an essay,

0:22:07.680,0:22:16.180
and I have a formal register for, like, talking to a professor but face-to-face or talking to a supervisor at work,

0:22:16.180,0:22:18.380
where I'm being formal and professional,

0:22:18.380,0:22:23.840
but I'm not going to be using the same types of sentence constructions and word choices

0:22:23.840,0:22:27.280
as in, like, an essay or my senior thesis or whatever.

0:22:27.280,0:22:33.380
JENNY: And then I've got a different register from both of those for, you know, texting my friends,

0:22:33.380,0:22:37.029
or talking to my friends face-to-face.

0:22:37.029,0:22:42.660
JENNY: And where the lines between your different registers are drawn is going to depend on

0:22:42.660,0:22:47.100
the social contexts in which you use them,

0:22:47.100,0:22:53.100
and so that can be kind of flexible, and vary from person to person.

0:22:53.100,0:22:56.400
JENNY: But everyone has different registers that they use,

0:22:56.400,0:23:04.120
and code switches between them, usually without, or often without realizing, that that's what they're doing.

0:23:04.120,0:23:08.000
SARAH: Mm-hm.
JENNY: So I think that I would consider baby talk

0:23:08.000,0:23:10.560
(or parentese, or whatever you
want to call that,)

0:23:10.560,0:23:15.920
a register that a lot of people use for talking to little kids.

0:23:15.920,0:23:18.700
ELI: I dig this explanation.
SARAH: Definitely.

0:23:18.700,0:23:24.700
ELI: And I tell you why I dig this explanation, and it's because of how people speak to their pets.

0:23:24.700,0:23:31.340
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: So, there are some people who baby talk to their pets, and there are some people who talk to their pets

0:23:31.340,0:23:35.500
ELI: as though they are fully-formed adults who also inhabit the house.

0:23:35.500,0:23:40.780
JENNY: Uh-huh.
ELI: And when I have, like, tried to baby talk to a pet and it's felt weird,

0:23:40.780,0:23:47.860
it's felt weird in the way that speaking to an adult like talking to a baby,

0:23:47.860,0:23:54.140
or like speaking formally in an informal situation, would feel weird.

0:23:54.140,0:23:59.800
ELI: So, it's the exact same feeling for me, and to me that's like,

0:23:59.800,0:24:03.200
you hit the nail right on the head with this being a register thing,

0:24:03.200,0:24:05.220
not a dialect or an accent thing.

0:24:05.220,0:24:11.180
SARAH: Yeah.
JENNY: Yeah, I hadn't thought about the pets part but I think you're right, and I think that makes a lot of sense.

0:24:11.180,0:24:14.660
SARAH and ELI: Cool .
ELI: Are we ready to move on to another question?

0:24:14.660,0:24:16.200
SARAH: Yeah.
JENNY: I'm good.

0:24:16.200,0:24:19.500
SARAH: All right, so our next question is from Georgia, via email,

0:24:19.500,0:24:25.300
and Georgia asks, "What's the most valuable way you believe that linguistics can improve society?"

0:24:25.300,0:24:28.920
ELI: Oooh, um, there are so many ways.

0:24:28.920,0:24:34.280
ELI: I think that we're really starting to see the way that springs to mind for me,

0:24:34.280,0:24:40.340
which is letting go of peevishness.

0:24:40.340,0:24:44.060
ELI: We're starting to see this happen a little bit,

0:24:44.060,0:24:48.740
as people start to understand the relationship between prescriptivism and descriptivism,

0:24:48.740,0:24:49.880
SARAH: Mm-hm.
JENNY: Mm-hm.

0:24:49.880,0:24:53.460
ELI: and this also just calls back to the register thing, because

0:24:53.460,0:24:58.840
there are places where you're going to want to be a little more conservative about how you speak,

0:24:58.840,0:25:02.620
and there are places where it's not going to matter so much.

0:25:02.620,0:25:10.100
ELI: The idea of prescriptivism, or linguistic peevery, is that there *aren't* different registers,

0:25:10.100,0:25:13.620
and I think people are really starting to realize that, no,

0:25:13.620,0:25:17.620
this is how people have always varied their speech,

0:25:17.620,0:25:21.980
ELI: and I think that that will open us to a point where

0:25:21.980,0:25:28.220
we stop judging people because of the register or dialect that they're using,

0:25:28.220,0:25:33.320
and understand it as a linguistic function of that person interacting with society

0:25:33.320,0:25:38.820
ELI: in a way that might have been unexpected to us, but isn't wrong or bad or evil.

0:25:38.820,0:25:40.460
SARAH: Mm-hm.
JENNY: Right.

0:25:40.460,0:25:47.420
ELI: Another outgrowth of that is starting to look at things like comparison between so-called "standard" American English

0:25:47.420,0:25:50.150
ELI: and African American Vernacular English,

0:25:50.150,0:25:57.740
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: where I think the general awareness of African American Vernacular English

0:25:57.740,0:26:05.720
as a solid alternate dialect of English, and also a disestablishment of so-called "standard" English

0:26:05.720,0:26:08.140
as having some kind of prestige,

0:26:08.140,0:26:15.320
would be a really valuable way to start breaking down an unconscious barrier in society.

0:26:15.320,0:26:16.840
SARAH: Mm-hm, yes.

0:26:16.840,0:26:23.320
SARAH: That's something I talk about with my students a lot. Not necessarily in that level of formality,

0:26:23.320,0:26:29.320
but when I talk about writing or I talk about formal usage of language for school purposes,

0:26:29.320,0:26:36.559
I try to impress on them that when we talk about grammar rules that you're learning in school,

0:26:36.559,0:26:42.540
it's not about "this is the only way to speak" but "this is a style that you should learn,

0:26:42.540,0:26:47.140
and that you should be able to use in an academic setting, or a formal setting,

0:26:47.140,0:26:51.480
because you convey not only the content of your words,

0:26:51.480,0:26:59.440
but also some emotion and some, like, information about your level of seriousness and whatever,

0:26:59.440,0:27:02.310
with the way that you get your content across."

0:27:02.310,0:27:11.980
SARAH: And so definitely black students, and also white students, or second language English users,

0:27:11.980,0:27:20.780
whatever English you're using in your free time, in your downtime, whatever your casual social register is,

0:27:20.780,0:27:23.920
it's probably going to be different from most of the other kids in the class.

0:27:23.920,0:27:31.000
SARAH: Probably in a group of twenty kids, I have like twelve different kinds of downtime social registers.

0:27:31.000,0:27:38.300
SARAH: What we're aiming for is like a single academic register that everyone can kind of agree on, so to speak,

0:27:38.300,0:27:43.180
and I think, Eli, you were saying that we run into trouble when people are like,

0:27:43.180,0:27:48.820
"Well, how come you're not using that very particular 'standard' register all the time?

0:27:48.820,0:27:52.400
Because I use it all the time, so how come everybody else doesn't use it all the time?"

0:27:52.400,0:27:57.700
SARAH: And yeah, I think we definitely are seeing that sort of deteriorate.

0:27:57.700,0:28:01.420
SARAH: Slowly, but we definitely are.

0:28:01.420,0:28:06.780
ELI: And more linguistic awareness of that, I think, would be a net positive on society.

0:28:06.780,0:28:07.600
SARAH: Yes.

0:28:07.600,0:28:11.200
JENNY: I think you could also draw a connection to

0:28:11.200,0:28:15.680
recognition of language evolution and language change, like the idea that

0:28:15.680,0:28:20.340
language changes, language always has changed, that's not a bad thing.

0:28:20.340,0:28:23.880
JENNY: The kids today aren't "ruining language,"

0:28:23.880,0:28:29.480
any more than they were when people talked about that fifty years ago, or two thousand years ago.

0:28:29.480,0:28:35.100
JENNY: Language changes, and that's fine.

0:28:35.100,0:28:42.680
JENNY: And I think that that has—like, people have also been kind of growing more aware of that,

0:28:42.680,0:28:44.540
JENNY: and talking about that more.
ELI: mmhmm

0:28:44.540,0:28:51.960
JENNY: And I think that can go hand-in hand with the "there are different versions of language already right now,

0:28:51.960,0:28:57.240
and that's also fine and the way language has always been," yeah?

0:28:57.240,0:29:05.240
SARAH: Yeah. I think it's interesting, too, because a lot of that, like, "there is one right way of talking,"

0:29:05.240,0:29:12.620
I feel like the recent problem, and—I have absolutely no evidence to back this up,

0:29:12.620,0:29:16.640
and I'm not looking for any because we don't do research, but…

0:29:16.640,0:29:22.540
SARAH: I would posit that that has a lot to do with the rise of mass communication,

0:29:22.540,0:29:25.820
such as radio and television, and now the internet,

0:29:25.820,0:29:32.780
where people are hearing the standard broadcast accent, the standard broadcast register,

0:29:32.780,0:29:41.180
and the people for whom that is their, like, native accent, native register of casual speech,

0:29:41.180,0:29:42.900
SARAH: they're like, "Oh, I'm doing it right,

0:29:42.900,0:29:47.760
I hear it validated," and even if it's subconscious, they're like, "Oh, this is the way things are."

0:29:47.760,0:29:52.160
SARAH: And then to hear other people not doing that, they're like,

0:29:52.160,0:29:58.240
"Why are they not doing that? That's just the way it is!" And they don't realize that not everyone has that.

0:29:58.240,0:30:05.220
SARAH: Which, I think about that a lot when I think about Great Britain, because every time I hear of a new accent,

0:30:05.220,0:30:11.120
or a new, like, regionalism, or like, "oh yeah, I can tell you're from this particular area of Great Britain,

0:30:11.120,0:30:13.240
because of you said this thing or whatever,"

0:30:13.240,0:30:20.680
it blows my mind, because I think about the same reactions I have to American and Canadian speakers,

0:30:20.680,0:30:26.560
and how much geographical space we have in North America,

0:30:26.560,0:30:33.320
and then comparatively how little geographical space there is in Great Britain.

0:30:33.320,0:30:36.680
SARAH: Like, as a country, it is not a big place.

0:30:36.680,0:30:43.040
JENNY: [laughs] No, it is not.
SARAH: And they have so many very distinct accents that are so small and so regional,

0:30:43.040,0:30:50.600
and like, there's no way that they are sitting there going, "oh, this is the Right Way to speak English."

0:30:50.600,0:30:53.480
SARAH: I mean, they probably are, because I'm sure there are people like that everywhere,

0:30:53.480,0:31:00.000
but you can't live in a country that small, and with the travel possibilities that we have now—

0:31:00.000,0:31:03.720
SARAH: like, you can go to all the cities in England if you want to,

0:31:03.720,0:31:07.020
and Scotland and Wales and Ireland and like in that area,

0:31:07.020,0:31:09.680
and hear so many different kinds of English,

0:31:09.680,0:31:13.260
SARAH: and you might like some of them better, you might, like,

0:31:13.260,0:31:16.720
dislike a certain group of people who speak a certain variety and therefore

0:31:16.720,0:31:20.800
be like, "Well the people I hate speak that way, so I hate that way of speaking,"

0:31:20.800,0:31:27.280
but you can't have that, like, weird underlying thought, that "Oh, there's one way of doing this."

0:31:27.280,0:31:33.260
SARAH: And I think a lot of the variation in North America,

0:31:33.260,0:31:37.920
there is still a ton of variation, but I think it's more… gradual?

0:31:37.920,0:31:42.820
SARAH: Like the difference between different parts of the Midwest,

0:31:42.820,0:31:45.920
and the different parts of New England, are subtler?

0:31:45.920,0:31:52.740
SARAH: And so—and even the transition from the Northeast into like the Mid-Atlantic into the Midwest,

0:31:52.740,0:31:56.040
there are hallmarks of each of those regions,

0:31:56.040,0:32:01.200
but they're not like a full-on, "Oh my god, I—you're not from here, you're so different,"

0:32:01.200,0:32:03.320
SARAH: and so... I don't know.

0:32:03.320,0:32:05.600
SARAH: I don't know where I was going with that, I'm sorry.

0:32:05.600,0:32:10.680
ELI: Well, I have a place to go with that, which is to talk about Received Pronunciation, or RP—

0:32:10.680,0:32:16.720
SARAH: Right.
ELI: —which is the BBC's—or actually *was* the BBC's—standard required accent

0:32:16.720,0:32:21.780
for all of its radio announcers and television announcers until very recently.

0:32:21.780,0:32:24.140
ELI: I think in the last ten or fifteen years,

0:32:24.140,0:32:30.940
the BBC allowed its anchors to not speak in RP, and instead speak in their native accent,

0:32:30.940,0:32:37.800
and now all of a sudden you hear Scottish accents and Northern accents and Welsh accents

0:32:37.800,0:32:40.480
all over the BBC, and it's fantastic,

0:32:40.480,0:32:47.320
but they used to have this standard, required,

0:32:47.320,0:32:53.080
ELI: one-size-fits-all thing for the entire country, which was then given prestige.

0:32:53.080,0:32:56.520
SARAH: Right.
ELI: And people considered that to—

0:32:56.520,0:33:00.340
ELI: I don't know if people considered it to be the one true way for everyday speech,

0:33:00.340,0:33:06.500
but it certainly was like a government-endorsed, "here is the accent that we think is right."

0:33:06.500,0:33:13.820
ELI: I wonder if your thing about regional differences in America being much more gradual,

0:33:13.820,0:33:22.500
despite the fact that we have much more area to cover, has to do with differing ideas of regional identity?

0:33:22.500,0:33:26.680
SARAH: Yeah, I feel like our regional identities are much bigger.
ELI: Yes.

0:33:26.680,0:33:30.780
SARAH: Like, we don't have a lot of stock in "I'm from this town,"

0:33:30.780,0:33:33.160
we have a lot of stock in "I'm from this state,"

0:33:33.160,0:33:36.020
SARAH: or even "I'm from this group of five states."

0:33:36.020,0:33:39.420
ELI: Yeah, exactly, I think, like—for example, my—

0:33:39.420,0:33:45.760
ELI: If somebody were to ask me like my core sub-American locative identity I would say,

0:33:45.760,0:33:50.720
ELI: like, I would first say Midwestern, before I would say Illinois or Chicago.

0:33:50.720,0:33:51.460
SARAH: Yeah.

0:33:51.460,0:33:53.180
SARAH: Yeah, and I guess that's what really gets me,

0:33:53.180,0:33:57.540
because I'm like, "We have these regions that are several states big,"

0:33:57.540,0:34:02.540
and then I look at the UK and I'm like, "You are *a* state.

0:34:02.540,0:34:07.240
I mean not really, you're like four states, but you're the size of some American states."

0:34:07.240,0:34:11.060
SARAH: And so to be like, "Oh, this region is like six of you,"

0:34:11.060,0:34:18.940
SARAH: but then you have SO many really distinct varieties in that small area, it's just baffling.

0:34:18.940,0:34:26.060
ELI: Yeah, you get people who are like,
"Excuse you, I'm from Stratford EAST of Avon, not Stratford WEST of Avon."

0:34:26.060,0:34:27.660
SARAH: Right.
[JENNY laughs]

0:34:27.660,0:34:31.220
JENNY: I will say, coming at this as someone who has spent

0:34:31.220,0:34:35.660
most of the last decade-and-then-some in California

0:34:35.660,0:34:41.700
throws things off a little bit, because I think I would say "Southern California" or "San Diego"

0:34:41.700,0:34:45.060
about as frequently as I would say "I'm from California"?

0:34:45.060,0:34:54.720
JENNY: Because Southern California and Northern California are very different regions in some ways.
SARAH: Yeah.

0:34:54.720,0:34:59.580
JENNY: But at the same time, like, California also definitely has

0:34:59.580,0:35:03.700
JENNY: an identity unto itself. 
ELI: I mean, California's huge.
JENNY: California's really big.

0:35:03.700,0:35:14.140
JENNY: California's *really* big.
SARAH: It's really big and it spans some continental, and, like, national United States region breaks,

0:35:14.140,0:35:18.680
SARAH: in a way that other big states like Alaska and Texas don't.
JENNY: Yep.

0:35:18.680,0:35:22.480
SARAH: So like—
JENNY: Because it's not just big, it's long.

0:35:22.480,0:35:25.260
ELI: Yeah.
SARAH: Right, it's long and it's along the coast,

0:35:25.260,0:35:31.340
SARAH: and so—like, Texas is enormous, but it's surrounded by other southern states only.

0:35:31.340,0:35:37.180
JENNY: Yep.
SARAH: Whereas California is surrounded by, like, southwestern states, on one end,

0:35:37.180,0:35:41.760
SARAH: and the Pacific Northwest on the other, and if you think about those regionally,

0:35:41.760,0:35:50.160
JENNY: Mm-hm.
SARAH: I don't—I cannot fathom a cultural or regional similarity between, like, Oregon and Arizona.

0:35:50.160,0:35:57.200
JENNY: So yeah, so that throws off the "I would say region first", because I think I would say

0:35:57.200,0:36:03.000
California sometimes and Southern California other times, depending on the context

0:36:03.000,0:36:07.640
JENNY: in which I'm being asked to explain where I'm from? but—

0:36:07.640,0:36:11.160
SARAH: Well in some ways, Southern California *is* the region level for you.

0:36:11.160,0:36:19.140
JENNY: Yeah. But regardless, the point is that like, the idea of having that many different regional identities

0:36:19.140,0:36:28.060
in one tiny, tiny geographical area is kind of all the more mind-boggling, because it's like,

0:36:28.060,0:36:38.640
JENNY: California is weird in terms of size and identity in like the exact opposite way, somehow.
SARAH: Yeah.

0:36:38.640,0:36:45.240
ELI: Switching gears a little bit, I also want to answer this question in a different way, which is that I think

0:36:45.240,0:36:54.380
contact with linguistics in general makes one more likely to be a polyglot, or learn a second language

0:36:54.380,0:36:58.640
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: And I think America is a really interesting place

0:36:58.640,0:37:02.660
because many people here do speak more than one language fluently,

0:37:02.660,0:37:07.060
but the majority of Americans speak only one language fluently,

0:37:07.060,0:37:12.280
ELI: and that is not true basically anywhere else in the world.

0:37:12.280,0:37:16.340
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: Everywhere else in the world, people are polyglots by default,

0:37:16.340,0:37:21.860
and not even necessarily just because oh, they have to learn English in school for business,

0:37:21.860,0:37:26.820
but because they're living in a place where they do actually have to use

0:37:26.820,0:37:31.300
both or all three of the languages that they know on a daily basis.

0:37:31.300,0:37:34.820
SARAH: Yeah.
ELI: And I think that knowing more than one language

0:37:34.820,0:37:42.400
expands your capacity to imagine different cultures, but I think it also probably promotes a little bit of wanderlust

0:37:42.400,0:37:47.500
ELI: to go learn about the people who speak that language, if it's not one that you're using every day.

0:37:47.500,0:37:52.060
SARAH: Yeah.
JENNY: That makes sense.
SARAH: It also, like—

0:37:52.060,0:38:00.340
SARAH: Even studying languages that you don't use on a daily basis or that you are unlikely to go visit,

0:38:00.340,0:38:07.120
for whatever reason—whether you are like me and studying historical languages that are not actively used anymore,

0:38:07.120,0:38:11.600
or you're studying a language from somewhere so far away that you don't have the funds

0:38:11.600,0:38:14.340
SARAH: or don't foresee ever having the funds to get there—

0:38:14.340,0:38:23.420
SARAH: I just think that studying a language, learning new words,  learning new ways that concepts can be delineated—

0:38:23.420,0:38:27.720
like the thing with the Swadesh list about, like, what words are culturally dependent?

0:38:27.720,0:38:32.540
SARAH: Why do we say claw and fingernail and then some people just use fingernail?

0:38:32.560,0:38:38.700
SARAH: Or, you know, where do we draw the lines between different types of family members or different colors?

0:38:38.700,0:38:43.140
SARAH: It just—it makes you think about the world, and makes you think about how brains work.

0:38:43.140,0:38:50.160
SARAH: And like, learning other languages has improved my English, I think,

0:38:50.160,0:38:54.240
because I've been exposed to different sentence patterns

0:38:54.240,0:38:58.820
and different, like, ways of emphasizing or caring about things

0:38:58.820,0:39:01.980
SARAH: in terms of how you express yourself,

0:39:01.980,0:39:09.100
and it kind of gives me more options. Like obviously not every sentence pattern from Chinese

0:39:09.100,0:39:13.740
is a valid sentence pattern in English—and there I go saying "Chinese";

0:39:13.740,0:39:15.800
I should say "Mandarin" 'cause that's what I know—

0:39:15.800,0:39:20.560
SARAH: but like, it makes you think and gives you a little bit of flexibility.

0:39:20.560,0:39:28.920
ELI: I think an interesting outgrowth of this is that different languages have different obligatory parts to them,

0:39:28.920,0:39:35.740
and a big example of this is evidentials,  which I won't go super deep into, but basically, in some languages,

0:39:35.740,0:39:42.620
you can't just assert a fact, you have to also state implicitly in the way that you're asserting that fact

0:39:42.620,0:39:48.080
how you know that fact, whether you saw it or heard it from somebody, or it's common knowledge,

0:39:48.080,0:39:52.600
ELI: or you don't know it but you think that it's true, or something like that.

0:39:52.600,0:40:00.140
ELI: And some languages have no way for you to just assert a fact without having the evidential on it,

0:40:00.140,0:40:04.880
SARAH: Mm-hm.
ELI: but in English, for example, and and many other common languages,

0:40:04.880,0:40:11.160
you don't have to obligatorily say how you know something. But you can!

0:40:11.160,0:40:17.500
ELI: There's nothing in English that stops you from saying, you know, "The sky is blue and that's common knowledge,"

0:40:17.500,0:40:26.740
ELI: right—
SARAH: Right.
ELI: —or "Oh, my friend has an appointment this afternoon, I saw it in her agenda" or whatever.

0:40:26.740,0:40:32.980
ELI: And so that's a different, you know—It's not just word order for sentence  pattern and that kind of thing,

0:40:32.980,0:40:38.500
it's also these kinds of obligatory things or different ways that tenses are broken up,

0:40:38.500,0:40:41.700
different ways of thinking about patterns in time,

0:40:41.700,0:40:44.720
and then you also mentioned kinship stuff, right,

0:40:44.720,0:40:52.430
where it's like, "Oh, are the uncles that are my mom's brothers different than the uncles that are my dad's brothers?"

0:40:52.430,0:41:00.640
Or like, "Are all of the people who are, you know, not directly in my immediate family

0:41:00.640,0:41:05.460
but at my generation, do I just have one name for them?" right,

0:41:05.460,0:41:11.620
ELI: which, there are some languages that do that. English doesn't. We have several different kinds of cousins for that.

0:41:11.620,0:41:15.660
SARAH: Yes, if we bother.
JENNY: Mm-hm.
ELI: If we bother, right.

0:41:15.660,0:41:22.220
ELI: So I—yeah, I think that it's a really great point, that it's not just

0:41:22.220,0:41:26.900
directly related to the language that you might be learning, but just the idea that

0:41:26.900,0:41:33.180
so many people tie ability to think and ability to express with the way that language happens,

0:41:33.180,0:41:39.040
ELI: that having your eyes opened to other options probably correlates—we don't do research—

0:41:39.040,0:41:43.980
ELI: it probably correlates with being able to more quickly understand

0:41:43.980,0:41:48.420
ELI: that somebody that you're talking with may not have that same frame of reference.
SARAH: Mm-hm.

0:41:48.420,0:41:56.700
JENNY: Right.
SARAH: So you two both definitely said what I think of maybe the top two most valuable ways,

0:41:56.700,0:42:04.329
but a third valuable thing that I thought about when Eli said "general contact with linguistics" is

0:42:04.329,0:42:15.360
realizing how influential language is and the study of language in virtually every other domain.

0:42:15.360,0:42:20.700
ELI: Oh, yeah.
JENNY: Yeah.
SARAH: There is a fantastic infographic—

0:42:20.700,0:42:24.540
I'm sure there's many of them; I will find one of them and put it in the show notes—

0:42:24.540,0:42:27.600
ELI: I know exactly the infographic that you're thinking of, though.

0:42:27.600,0:42:31.640
SARAH: Yeah. Yeah, it's like a giant circle, and some versions of it

0:42:31.640,0:42:36.560
is like, a circle in the middle and then a bunch of circles overlapping it like a giant Venn diagram,

0:42:36.560,0:42:42.660
and then some of them it's just a circle in the middle with like an outer circle and pie slices,

0:42:42.660,0:42:45.060
but it's like, okay here's linguistics in the middle,

0:42:45.060,0:42:51.880
and then on the outside there's like biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics,

0:42:51.880,0:43:00.800
sociology, psychology, economics, blah blah blah blah blah, like, so many different domains of knowledge and work and stuff,

0:43:00.800,0:43:08.640
and then between those two rings there's "how does linguistics help the study of that thing."

0:43:08.640,0:43:15.020
SARAH: And I challenge you all to think of a domain—go to the show notes, look at the one I put there,

0:43:15.020,0:43:18.280
think of something that's NOT on the outside of this diagram,

0:43:18.280,0:43:24.760
and if you can't—or if you ask us and we can't—come up with a way that linguistics is involved with,

0:43:24.760,0:43:27.600
or could help, the study of that thing…

0:43:27.600,0:43:32.460
[pause] I will be absolutely amazed. Like—

0:43:32.460,0:43:36.980
ELI: I think—linguistics is such a young discipline, at least modern linguistics,
SARAH: Yes.

0:43:36.980,0:43:43.580
ELI: Right, like linguistics goes back literally thousands of years, but linguistics as an academic discipline

0:43:43.580,0:43:51.480
is so young that I think A) it has all of these really great overlaps, but B) they're not recognized yet,

0:43:51.480,0:43:55.160
and they're not recognized that way in larger society, either.

0:43:55.160,0:44:04.760
ELI: Like every time that a podcast or radio programmer or a TV show needs to know something about language, and they go and talk to a literature professor—

0:44:04.760,0:44:12.340
JENNY: Uh-huh!
ELI: —or like a journalist or a psychology professor who isn't doing linguistic psychology,

0:44:12.340,0:44:18.440
you know, it's like, I'm not sure that they know that linguistics exists and that there are people who specialize in these.

0:44:18.440,0:44:27.100
ELI: Which is not to say that journalists and literature professors and psychologists don't know about language—they do! Because there's such big overlap,

0:44:27.100,0:44:35.760
but also there is an entire discipline that is all about language, and you could go just to the source, but I think people don't know that yet.

0:44:35.760,0:44:43.680
SARAH: Right, not to mention every linguist's least favorite question: "Oh, you're a linguist? How many languages do you speak?"

0:44:43.680,0:44:48.900
SARAH: Because yeah, a lot of us speak a lot of languages, but that's not actually what we're doing with our time.

0:44:48.900,0:44:56.520
ELI: Exactly.
SARAH: A lot of us speak a lot of languages because in order to learn *about* languages, you have to know what they are.

0:44:56.520,0:45:00.160
JENNY: [laughs]
ELI: Well, and all three hosts of this podcast,

0:45:00.160,0:45:07.500
we are all linguists and none of us is in a higher education academic setting.

0:45:07.500,0:45:15.160
ELI: None of us are doing professional linguistics, but I think all of us use linguistics in the things that we do.

0:45:15.160,0:45:16.660
SARAH: Yes.
JENNY: Mm-hm.

0:45:16.660,0:45:23.580
SARAH: so that's my thing. I think linguistics as a field can improve society just by existing

0:45:23.580,0:45:30.520
and by contributing in all of those overlapping ways, and I think that society recognizing that

0:45:30.520,0:45:36.680
would double that impact, because they would be able to go intentionally reach out

0:45:36.680,0:45:42.600
in those ways that they maybe don't realize they can now, and get the support that they're looking for!

0:45:42.620,0:45:44.440
JENNY: Yeah, that's a really good point.

0:45:44.440,0:45:51.520
ELI: Okay, so that was a lot of serious discussion. Now let's move on to a little bit more of a silly question.

0:45:51.520,0:45:56.500
Masha asks via Twitter: "What's your favorite ridiculous etymology?

0:45:56.500,0:46:03.240
What's the etymology that when you tell people, they respond with 'fuck you, that's not where that word comes from!'?"

0:46:03.240,0:46:14.220
SARAH: Um, okay, so I have several. I'm pretty sure I'm known in my friend group for not having a swear jar but having the unsolicited etymology jar.

0:46:14.220,0:46:16.540
ELI: Oh, I'm so sorry for your wallet.

0:46:16.540,0:46:21.300
SARAH: I know, it's pretty rough, but uh. It's cool.

0:46:21.300,0:46:27.060
SARAH: Anyway, so there's the fact that "canary" is derived from the word for dog,

0:46:27.060,0:46:30.600
"easel" is derived from the word for donkey,

0:46:30.600,0:46:34.000
and "lettuce" is derived from the word for milk.

0:46:34.000,0:46:39.460
ELI: [laughs] Okay?
SARAH: So there's that! But my favorite one,

0:46:39.460,0:46:45.460
and the one with the best story attached, is that the word "money"—as in the stuff that you pay

0:46:45.460,0:46:53.240
in order to receive goods and services—comes from the verb "to warn," as in to, like, "admonish," which also comes from that word.

0:46:53.240,0:46:58.120
ELI and JENNY: Oooh...
SARAH: And I was explaining this to some students,

0:46:58.120,0:47:04.660
and they were like, "Oh, is it because you warn someone with money?"

0:47:04.660,0:47:10.560
or like, "something something bank loans and paying back things?"

0:47:10.560,0:47:15.260
SARAH: and I was like, "Wow, you guys are really creative! and no. It is none of those things."

0:47:15.260,0:47:20.000
ELI: [laughs]
SARAH: [laughs] They were really impressive guesses! They just, none of them were right.

0:47:20.000,0:47:24.140
SARAH: Um, no, so what happened was, the ancient Romans,

0:47:24.140,0:47:28.960
in, like—oh, this is embarrassing, that I don't know the year,

0:47:28.960,0:47:32.840
but I'll put it in the show notes—it was like… something BC.

0:47:32.840,0:47:36.260
SARAH: I want to say 356. We'll find out how close I was.

0:47:36.260,0:47:44.940
SARAH: Anyway, in something BC that might have been 356, the Romans were having a battle-slash-war

0:47:44.940,0:47:55.060
with a tribe of Gauls—so, people from modern-day France—and they went and, like, hid or kind of like took cover,

0:47:55.060,0:48:03.580
in this temple in Rome, because the Gauls had come to, like, attack the city and so the Roman fighters were hiding out in this temple.

0:48:03.580,0:48:14.740
SARAH: And they assumed (stupidly) that the Gauls were going to kind of adhere to the ancient kind of rules of war, which were,

0:48:14.740,0:48:22.140
you fight during the day and at night everybody goes to sleep and then gets up to stab each other in the morning.

0:48:22.140,0:48:27.100
SARAH: And so the Romans are in this temple—it was a temple to Juno,

0:48:27.100,0:48:37.120
and she was the, like, queen of the Olympian gods, Hera, called Juno in Latin, and so it was a temple to her—

0:48:37.120,0:48:41.900
and they're hiding out in there. They have some scouts who are supposed to be keeping watch overnight while everyone else is sleeping,

0:48:41.900,0:48:46.640
and I don't know if the scouts fell asleep, or were distracted, or like what happened,

0:48:46.640,0:48:51.980
but they didn't notice the Gauls climbing up the hill toward the temple in the middle of the night.

0:48:51.980,0:48:58.100
SARAH: But the ones who did notice that happening were the geese who lived on that hill,

0:48:58.100,0:49:06.040
SARAH: and if you know one thing about geese—
ELI: [laughs]
SARAH: —it's that they are mean, and they are loud.

0:49:06.040,0:49:12.920
SARAH: And so these geese notice that there are some strange humans climbing their hill in the dark,

0:49:12.920,0:49:15.700
and the geese are not pleased with this,

0:49:15.700,0:49:19.500
so they go and attack the Gauls, very loudly,

0:49:19.500,0:49:25.840
SARAH: and the Gauls, I'm sure, loudly go, "What the fuck, *geese*!!", as you do.
ELI: [laughs]

0:49:25.840,0:49:31.560
And the Romans wake up because they're like, "What the fuck, *geese*!!", and—
ELI: As you do.
SARAH: As you do.

0:49:31.560,0:49:36.800
SARAH: And they look out and they see the geese attacking the Gauls and they're like, "Oh crap, Gauls."

0:49:36.800,0:49:41.940
SARAH: So they, you know, get up, grab their stuff, go in the middle of the night, manage to defend themselves,

0:49:41.940,0:49:45.260
drive the Gauls off, however this battle and war wind up.

0:49:45.260,0:49:49.420
JENNY: All while presumably avoiding the geese?
SARAH: Presumably avoiding the geese, yes.

0:49:49.420,0:49:53.200
SARAH: And so the battle winds up, the war winds up,

0:49:53.200,0:50:01.680
and the Romans say, "Juno, thank you! You have saved our butts, we are going to rename this temple—"

0:50:01.680,0:50:08.400
SARAH: or not *rename* it, but a lot of the temples were, like, the temple of God Name the Somebody.

0:50:08.400,0:50:11.960
SARAH: They had all these epithets with them, so there were temples to different aspects of the gods.

0:50:11.960,0:50:14.800
SARAH: So this became the temple to Juno Moneta:

0:50:14.800,0:50:21.680
Juno the Warner, Juno who gave us this warning about the Gauls, via her now sacred geese.

0:50:21.680,0:50:28.000
ELI: Okay, that all makes sense. Where does the currency bit come in?
SARAH: Yup. So over time,

0:50:28.000,0:50:37.060
a lot of the temples in the city of Rome also began to serve other, like, governmental administrative purposes.

0:50:37.060,0:50:44.760
The temple of Saturn was like the Treasury, the temple of Castor and Pollux held all of the census records, if I recall correctly,

0:50:44.760,0:50:50.360
and the temple of Juno Moneta became the mint, where they actually produced coins.

0:50:50.360,0:50:57.060
ELI: Oh!
SARAH: And so, I don't know exactly how it happened, but at some point "Moneta" turned into "money,"

0:50:57.060,0:50:58.900
SARAH: and so that's where we got that from.

0:50:58.900,0:51:04.000
JENNY: Huh!
ELI: I mean, I bet it's through "mint," because that sort of—I've always wondered

0:51:04.000,0:51:08.720
about where the word "mint", as in a thing that prints money, comes from.

0:51:08.720,0:51:12.140
ELI: Pretty clearly comes directly from Moneta.

0:51:12.140,0:51:16.040
SARAH: Hmm, I never thought about that!
ELI: And so probably "money" comes in through "mint."

0:51:16.040,0:51:19.580
SARAH: Yeah, I'll have to look that one up. Check the show notes, friends!

0:51:19.580,0:51:29.180
ELI: I wonder—this is totally unsubstantiated—but I wonder if "mint" was reanalyzed as some sort of nominal past thing,

0:51:29.180,0:51:37.160
ELI: where you had, like, money… mint… I'm just trying to figure out how that "t" was dropped.
SARAH: Oh, yeah, like "moneyed", "minted", yeah.

0:51:37.160,0:51:41.000
ELI: Yeah, that's probably entirely false.
SARAH: Cool idea, though!

0:51:41.000,0:51:50.400
ELI: Okay, that is super cool. Now there is no epic war story to go with my favorite fuck-you etymology.

0:51:50.400,0:52:03.240
ELI: I, I do—there are some false friends that I like, so like the fact that "island" and "isle" come from two different things?
SARAH: Oh!

0:52:03.240,0:52:08.320
JENNY: Huh!
ELI: So that's another one where ⟨island⟩ just comes from a Germanic ⟨iland⟩,

0:52:08.320,0:52:12.040
and the ⟨s⟩ was put in there because people liked Latin.

0:52:12.040,0:52:19.100
SARAH: [laughs] Okay!
ELI: And ⟨isle⟩ actually comes from ⟨isla⟩.
SARAH: And then ⟨insula⟩. Yeah, okay.
ELI: Right.

0:52:19.100,0:52:24.700
ELI: There's also ⟨OK⟩, which is the only acronym etymology that's actually correct.

0:52:24.700,0:52:32.880
SARAH AND JENNY: [laugh]
SARAH: Or you might say "oll korrect"? ELI: Yes, exactly.
JENNY: [laughs]

0:52:32.880,0:52:43.180
ELI: But the one that I want to talk about is actually the word ⟨lox⟩. So lox, which, at least in American English, means smoked salmon.

0:52:43.180,0:52:51.980
ELI: So you take salmon and you cure it and then you cold smoke it and then you slice it up and then you put it on a bagel that has a lot of cream cheese on it.

0:52:51.980,0:53:02.780
ELI: That's lox.
SARAH: And it's spelled L-O-X, right?
ELI: It's spelled L-O-X in English. In a lot of other languages it's spelled L-A-X.
SARAH: Okay.

0:53:02.780,0:53:10.560
ELI: But I like lox's etymology because "lox," the word, has not changed.

0:53:10.560,0:53:19.720
ELI: It has not changed for as far back as we can trace it, using the comparative method and other types of historical linguistic analysis.

0:53:19.720,0:53:26.500
ELI: If you go all the way back as far as you can, you still get this word "lax,"

0:53:26.500,0:53:32.160
which might mean salmon specifically but also might mean fish kind of in general,

0:53:32.160,0:53:34.540
ELI: or like a fish that we eat.
SARAH: Cool.

0:53:34.540,0:53:41.780
ELI: But that's my favorite etymology, not because it's, like, unexpected where it comes from, but it's kind of unexpected where it went.

0:53:41.780,0:53:44.670
SARAH and JENNY: Yeah.
SARAH: What language did it originate in?

0:53:44.670,0:53:48.020
ELI: I'm pretty sure it's proto-Germanic.
SARAH: That's so cool.

0:53:48.020,0:53:51.540
ELI: Also, lox is delicious.
SARAH: True facts.
JENNY: Fair.

0:53:51.540,0:53:56.820
ELI: So it deserves to have not changed.
SARAH: [laughs]
ELI: The collective wisdom of humanity

0:53:56.820,0:54:02.569
deems that this fish was so delicious we should not have changed the word for it.

0:54:02.569,0:54:12.120
ELI: I also think that in some Scandinavian languages, "lox" just means salmon, it doesn't specifically mean smoked salmon, or like cured and smoked salmon.

0:54:12.120,0:54:21.080
SARAH: mm-hmm
ELI: I think that it's just what you call lox or what you call salmon. But it shows up in things like gravlax and that kind of thing as well.

0:54:21.080,0:54:23.820
ELI: Jenny, do you have a favorite etymology?

0:54:23.820,0:54:30.420
JENNY: My favorite is contextual. My favorite is whichever one I'm getting to explain to one of my siblings.
SARAH: [laughs] Good answer.

0:54:30.420,0:54:34.339
JENNY: So, on every podcast we have a puzzler.

0:54:34.339,0:54:41.840
JENNY: Last time our puzzler was "what's an English word spelled with three double letters in a row?"

0:54:41.840,0:54:48.260
JENNY: The answer is "bookkeeper"—double-O, double-K, double-E,

0:54:48.260,0:54:52.140
or "woolen—" 'double-U', double-O, double-L.

0:54:52.140,0:54:55.840
JENNY: If that was your answer, either of them, good job!

0:54:55.840,0:55:00.280
JENNY: So for a new puzzler, what do we have this time?
ELI: We have another word puzzle.

0:55:00.280,0:55:09.560
ELI: It's short and sweet, just like last episode's. I'm gonna spell three words and your task is to figure out what they have in common.

0:55:09.560,0:55:21.060
ELI: The three words are J-O-B, P-O-L-I-S-H, and H-E-R-B.

0:55:21.060,0:55:27.240
ELI: Now there's a reason that I'm spelling them. It has to do with what they have in common. That's the only hint you're gonna get.

0:55:27.240,0:55:35.300
ELI: I'm sure it's pretty easy to look this one up on the internet, but again that's cheating, and if you cheat you should feel bad about yourself.

0:57:11.700,0:57:17.640
