- 37:21 Audio question! Is linguistics a science? Is it a prestigious science? Why or why not?
- 58:03 What are your favorite words that don’t have an English equivalent or cannot be translated into English?
- 1:16:20 Listeners, what are your favorite loan words that haven’t yet been italicized in English?
- 1:18:18 The puzzler: Think of an informal term for a beverage. Now say it in pig Latin, and you'll have an informal term for another beverage. What two beverages are these?

## Covered in this episode:
- How learning different languages makes you rethink one-word-at-a-time analysis
