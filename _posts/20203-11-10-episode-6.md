- 2:26 Language Thing of the Day: Filler words
- 14:17 Question 1: How did we get nicknames that don't seem to make sense? Like how did “Peggy” come out of “Margaret”?
- 25:26 Question 2: Why do singers’ accents almost always become less intense in their singing voices as opposed to their speaking voices?
- 37:30 Question 3: How do we change the meaning of a sentence just by changing vocal pitch? Typed-out transcripts can lose the information conveyed by vocal pitch.
- 1:04:32 Answer to last week’s puzzler
- 1:07:39 The puzzler: You have moved into a house and want to label your mailbox so that you can get mail. You live at number 12 on the street you have just moved to and want to spell it out in letters: “twelve.” So, you go to the hardware store, but none of the items in the store have labels to tell you what the price is. You get in line with the letters you took, and there are three people in front of you also buying stick-on letters. The first one buys the letters in “one” and pays $2. The second one buys the letters in “two” and pays $3. The third person buys the letters in “eleven” and pays $5. How much will it cost you to buy the letters in the word “twelve”?
