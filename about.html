  <h2>What is Linguistics After Dark?</h2>
  <p>
    Lingustics After Dark is a podcast where three linguists (and sometimes other people) answer your burning questions about language, linguistics, and whatever else you need advice about. Think of it like a fun conversation with some people you met at a bar: off-the-cuff, a little drunk, and a no-consequences opportunity to see if your pet theory about all words being derived from Greek holds any water.
