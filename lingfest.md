**Linguistics After Dark: Live @ LingFest!**
====

Modern usage got you tense? Can’t start up your conjugator? Or maybe you’d just like to make like a schwa and destress. Call into our live show with your burning language questions and our two linguist hosts will answer them for you. Just one catch: we can’t do any research before answering. So if your language is making a funny noise, we’ll get to the bottom of it, with some rowdy discussion, bad nerdy jokes, and a lot of linguistics along the way.

Join us on YouTube (link coming soon) at 3pm EDT/12pm PDT on April 24 for a couple hours of chaotic language fun, and this time we'll be taking your questions LIVE!

The event will be autocaptioned live, and then we will edit the captions for the permanent post, and add a transcript.

Admission is free with no need to register, but [Ko-fi tips](https://ko-fi.com/emfozzing) are much appreciated!
